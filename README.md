# Bookshop Evolution Project

This project demonstrates the evolution of a Bookshop application through different implementations, each with a unique approach to data management and system architecture.

## Overview

The project is divided into 5 main versions, each building upon the previous one:

1. V1 - Basic management with HashSet
2. V2 - Reading and writing to CSV file
3. V3 - Database integration with JDBC
4. V4 - Servlet implementation and DAO pattern
5. V5 - RESTful API with Spring Boot (in development)

## Project Structure

Each version of the project is contained in a separate branch:

- `V1-hashset`
- `V2-IO`
- `V3-jdbc`
- `V4-Servlet`
- `V5-SpringBoot` (in development)

## Main Features

- Book catalog management
- User management
- Book lending system

## Technologies Used

- Java17
- JDBC
- Servlets
- SpringBoot3.3.1
- MySQL
- JUnit5
- Mockito

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Checkout to the desired version branch
3. Follow the specific instructions in the README of each branch

## Project Versions

### V1 - Basic management with HashSet

Basic implementation of the bookshop using HashSet for in-memory data management.

### V2 - Reading and writing to CSV file

Evolution that introduces data persistence using CSV files.

### V3 - Database integration with JDBC

Implementation that uses JDBC for connection and data management with MySQL database.

### V4 - Servlet implementation and DAO pattern

Introduction of the MVC pattern with Servlets and implementation of the DAO pattern for data access.

### V5 - RESTful API with Spring Boot

(In development) Implementation of RESTful API using the Spring Boot framework.

## Testing

Each version includes a test suite to verify the correct functionality of the implemented features.
